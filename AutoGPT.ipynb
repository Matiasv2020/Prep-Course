The seller acts as a middleman between the supplier and the customer, and earns a profit by marking up the price of the products. This business model requires minimal investment and can be operated from anywhere with an internet connection. 2. Online fashion boutique: An online fashion boutique is a retail business that sells clothing, accessories, and other fashion items through an e-commerce website. The boutique can specialize in a particular niche, such as sustainable fashion, plus-size clothing, or vintage clothing. The business can be operated from anywhere with an internet connection, and can be started with a relatively low investment. However, the competition in the online fashion industry is high, and the business requires a strong marketing strategy to stand out. 3. Handcrafted and homemade goods business: A handcrafted and homemade goods business is a retail business that sells handmade products such as jewelry, pottery, candles, and other crafts. The business can be operated online or through a physical store, and can be started with a low investment.
